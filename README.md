## Introduction
For my Third Year Graph Theory Project I have been asked to design and prototype a Neo4j database for use
in a timetabling system for a third level institute. The minimum standard for this project is a document detailing the design of the database and a prototype Neo4j database following that design and using data from GMIT. I based my project on the timetabling system of my course year, which is Software Development Year 3.

The timetable system that I am to devise is to contain nodes, relationships, labels, relationship types and properties in Neo4j. When coming up with the idea for my project I made sure to keep this in mind and use them wisely in my database.
